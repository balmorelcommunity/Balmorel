* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between 3.02 and 3.03 (20151127). Main changes only.
All identifiers with "xxxDERATE" have been replaced by "xxxRATE"
    as response to factual practice by some users,
    and because RATE provides wider range of values (e.g. greater than 1) than DERATE
    xxxRATE input data may be obtained from xxxDERATE as xxxRATE = 1-xxxDERATE.
HYRSDATAS renamed HYRSDATASET
Removed DAYTYPE, SCENARIO, SCENARSIM, IDAYSIN_S, IHOURSIN24.
Added  ALIAS: (CCCRRRAAA,CCCRRRAAAALIAS), (IR,IRE,IRI), (FFF,IFFFALIAS), (S,IS3LOOPSET).
Added GSOLH, GWAVE, GHSTO_S, IGHSTO_S, IGHSTOALL, IGWAVE, IAGK, WAVE_VAR_T, IWAVESUMST, WAVEFLH,
    VGF_T, VGFN_T, QHYMAXG, ,
Added a number of VQxxx variables.
Added a number of tax data possibilities.
Used acronyms more consistently in relation to GDTYPE and fueltype.
Use of default values (to possibly reduce size of input data files or as first shot on workable data)
    have been introduced in a number of parameters:
    GEFFRATE, XKRATE, GKRATE, GKNMAX, IGKRATE, IXKRATE (GOMVCOST, GOMFCOST and GINVCOST as previously).
Use of domain overloading to permit choise of level of detail in input data files
    to not require more data than needed for a specific application or than available:
    GMINF, GMAXF, GEQF, XKRATE, GKRATE. Cf. balopt.opt.
Reduced the size of the large parameters by assigning 0 to unused entries.
Not all addons are alive and documented, some will be deleted others documented (put otherwise: a mess).
