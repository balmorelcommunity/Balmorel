# Pre-Processing

The data format of Balmorel is .inc-files. There are different approaches to pre-processing, the simplest being creating a new .inc-file through GAMS Studio. [xls2gams](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_XLS2GMS.html) Can be used to produce .inc-files from excel sheets, and for python we recommend the [IncFile class](https://balmorelcommunity.github.io/pybalmorel/autoapi/pybalmorel/classes/index.html#pybalmorel.classes.IncFile) from our [pybalmorel](https://balmorelcommunity.github.io/pybalmorel) package.
