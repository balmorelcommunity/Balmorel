# Balmorel GitHub Tutorial

This tutorial will show, how to work with **Balmorel** on **GitHub**. It will cover the basic steps of:
- **Forking** the **Balmorel** and **Balmorel_data** repository.
- **Cloning** the repository to your **local PC** or **HPC** and setting up the folder structure
- **Commiting** changes and pushing them upstream to your **remote repository**
- Creating your own **branch**
- Making a **pull request** to merge into the **master branch**

## GitHub, VS Code, or command line

We offer **three different paths** for this exercise:
- **GitHub** (this is the one we will demonstrate)
- **VS Code** (if you prefer to follow along using an editor)
- **Command line** (for people comfortable with the command line)
