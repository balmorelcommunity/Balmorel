# Scenario Setup
Lets start by learning how to execute Balmorel using a small test scenario. Create a new folder in the level of the base folder, create a new model folder inside of this and copy and paste the Balmorel.gms, balopt.opt

To setup Balmorel in GAMS Studio, you can drag and drop the Balmorel.gms into GAMS Studio to create a correctly setup project.
