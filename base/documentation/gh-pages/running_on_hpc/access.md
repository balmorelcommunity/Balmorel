# Accessing the Cluster

A general guide for accessing the DTU clusters by the DTU Computing Center can be found [here](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=2501). See the "Command line: SSH access" section to understand how to access via PuTTY. 

Note that you should not transfer large files via the login nodes (e.g. login.gbar.dtu.dk), but through the transfer nodes (e.g. transfer.gbar.dtu.dk). Follow [this guide](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=4377) for transfers using WinSCP.
