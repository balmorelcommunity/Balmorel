# Running on HPC

It will probably be necessary to run Balmorel on a high-performance computer (HPC).

This section will explain how to do this on the [LSF 10 Cluster](https://www.hpc.dtu.dk/?page_id=2513) of the Technical University of Denmark, but the instructions may also be applicable to other Linux-based clusters. Note that obviously only students and employees of DTU can access this specific cluster.
