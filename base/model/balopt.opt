* This file holds options that are used to control model functionality,
* including extentions in the form of addons, and interplay between models.

* Note: in final version all relevant control settings will be indicated
* by an *!option statement, e.g. "*!option yes" and other instructions.

* Note: If you work with BUI, the above is mandatory.
* Moreover, the only way to enter a comment in this file
* is to use a '*' as the first character on the line;
* thus, you can not use e.g., $ontext..$offtext or /*..*/ or // or !!.
* Further, if you work with BUI, this file will not be $included into Balmorel.gms,
* instead the file Balopt.bui will be $included. See the description elsewhere.


* Debugging hints are available if you include feasiblity-ensuring variables.
* However, adding more variables will increase calculation time.
* Hence, if calculation time is an issue, it is recommended as default to not use them,
* and then, if the solver declares the problem infeasible, use them and resolve.
* Information of ... in the .log file?

*
* CASEID is the Case identification string. It can be assigned freely, however, if
* the case is a base case to which other cases should be compared the name should be
* BASE. Normally the model in the base directory will be called BASE while
* any variants will have names as appropriate. Model results in the form of GDX files
* (or Access MDBs) will have the CASEID as filename with the appropriate extension.
* Note that CASEID MUST be identical to folder name of the diretory holding the case.

* The savepoint attribute tells GAMS to save a GDX file that contains the information on the current solution point.

* Comparison between Cases:
*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The following will merge and/or compare two results.
* With  option MERGECASE is set to NONE this will be not be done, otherwise it will.
* If done, the result will be in the output folder of the present case in the form of a GDX file.
* With option MERGEDSAVEPOINTRESULTS2MDB" this may then be transferred to a MDB file.
* All output go to the output folder of the present case.
* Similar considerations for DIFFCASE.

* MERGEWITH defines the case with which to merge results.
$setglobal MERGEWITH CaseNonversioned
*!option <case name>   !mustif not %MERGECASE%==none

* The diff uses gdxdiff. The diffile only shows items that meaningfull can be compared,
* non-compared items are reported in the Balmorel.log file.

* Option semislash is used to control input data format for text files.
* With "$Setglobal semislash ;" the input files must include
* the declaration statement initially and must terminate with a "/;".
* With "$Setglobal semislash /" the input files do not contain this, but only data.
* Note that parameters and tables are identical declarations, however,
* when using "$Setglobal semislash /" make sure
* that the use of either "parameter" or "table" in Balmorel.gms for any data file
* corresponds to the data format used in the file.
* NOTE: Rev.3.03: Not fully implemented yet, you MUST use "$Setglobal semislash ;".
