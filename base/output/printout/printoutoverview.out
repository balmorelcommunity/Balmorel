Option PRINTFILES was set at yes, therefore some files will be printed.
Which files that are printed will depend on additional options' settings.

The naming of the printout files is made according to the following idea:
The first letter(s) indicate(s) the subject of the output files.
Then there is an underscore followed by letters which indicate the level of detail.
 C, R or A indicates the geographical level of detail.
 Y, S or T indicates the level of time segments.
 G indicates that information for each particular technology is available.
 Z is used to summarise over the following letters.
If there are no letters to identify the geographic level
the file contains information for all countries that are simulated in Balmorel.
If there is no letter to identify the time segments
the file contains information for the whole time span that is simulated in Balmorel.

In summary, the content of the output files are indicated by the following letters used in the file names:
 E: Electricity
 H: Heat
 F: Fuels
 M: Emissions (MCO2, MSO2 and MNOx)
 G: Generation
 D: Demand
 P: Prices
 K: Capacity
 X: Transmission
 O: Old (exogenously specified) plants
 N: New plants
 C: Country
 R: Region
 A: Area
 Y: Year
 S: Season
 T: Time period within season
 Z: Summation
