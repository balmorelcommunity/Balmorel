# dk-highspatialres

The [dk-highspatialres branch](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel/tree/dk-highspatialres) is used for analysing the effect of various spatial resolutions in Denmark. The [poster below](mberos-spatialagg) illustrates a case study for the EGU 2024 conference, with source codes under the [EGU 2024 Poster](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel/releases/tag/egu24-poster) tag in all mentioned repositories here. 

The pre-processing of raw data is performed using the [following balmorel-preprocessing tool](https://github.com/Mathias157/balmorel-preprocessing/), and the prepared .inc-files for the fully resolved model can be found in the [data repository](https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel_data/tree/dk-highspatialres).
